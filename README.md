### Hey there! I'm Carl. ðŸ‘‹

Fledgling Data Scientist with experience in Python and SQL. I'm well-versed in Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Numpy, Tensorflow, and Keras. With a passion for all things data, I love learning, and I love machine learning! My background is in Music Theory and Composition, which lends itself well to analysis and project management.

I have a practical mind and a positive attitude. If the first solution doesn't work, it's just an opportunity to look for a better solution.
